# Privacy Policy

Wallamac does not collect any data by its own. Only data explicitly shared by
the user is processed.
This only happens when the user is sharing a link via the app.

Apart from links only the username, password and api credentials are saved.
This data is saved in the keychain of the Mac and not shared with any party
besides the chosen Wallabag instance in order to authenticate the user.

Please refer to the Privacy Policy of your Wallabag instance to see how your
data is processed there.

## Data processors

No data is processed by any third party except your chosen Wallabag instance.

## How we collect data

Wallamac does not collect data itself. Data is only forwarded to your selected
Wallabag instance.

As with all apps in the Apple AppStore some crash reports may be collected.

## How we use data

No data is used.

## How we disclose data

No data is disclosed unless you actively save a link to wallabag.

## The data subject's right

You can delete your credentials within the `Keychain Access` and remove every
entry containing `de.jandamm.wallabag.SharedKeychain`.

To delete the shared links please check the manual of Wallabag.

## How to complain

Shoot me a mail mail+wallamac@jandamm.de or create an issue in this GitHub
repository.
